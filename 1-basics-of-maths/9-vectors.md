## Vectors

### 📝 Explanation

A **vector** is a quantity that has:

1. **Magnitude** (how big it is)
2. **Direction** (which way it points)

Vectors are often represented as **arrows** in space, or as **lists of numbers** in math/ML.

* Example in 2D: 

$$
(\vec{v} = [3, 4])
$$

  * 3 → movement along X-axis
  * 4 → movement along Y-axis
* Magnitude of a vector:

$$
  [
  |\vec{v}| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
  ]
$$

### 🌍 Analogy

Imagine **walking in a city**:

* You walk 3 blocks east (X) and 4 blocks north (Y).
* Your **vector** = [3,4].
* The straight-line distance from start → destination = magnitude = 5 blocks.

### 📊 Examples

1. Vector A = [2, 3], Vector B = [1, -1]
2. Adding vectors: A + B = [2+1, 3+(-1)] = [3,2]
3. Scalar multiplication: 2 × A = [4,6]

### ❓ Socratic Questions

1. If vector A = [0,5] and vector B = [5,0], what does A + B represent geometrically?
2. Why do you think vectors are so important in machine learning (hint: think features in multi-dimensional space)?

### 🏋️‍♂️ Mini Exercise

Given vectors:

$$
[
\vec{A} = [2,3], \quad \vec{B} = [4,1]
]
$$

1. Compute $ (\vec{A} + \vec{B}) $
2. Compute $ (|\vec{A}|) (magnitude) $

Do you want to solve this first, or should I walk you step by step?
