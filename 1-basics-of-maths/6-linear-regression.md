## Linear Regression

### 📝 Explanation

**Linear Regression** is a method to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a straight line.

* One variable = **independent variable (X)** (the input, cause, or predictor).
* Another variable = **dependent variable (Y)** (the output, effect, or response).

We try to find the **best-fitting line**:

$$
[
Y = mX + c
]
$$

Where:

* (m) = slope (how much Y changes when X increases by 1)
* (c) = intercept (the value of Y when X = 0)

### 🌍 Analogy

Imagine you’re **predicting salary based on years of experience**:

* As experience (X) increases, salary (Y) usually increases.
* The regression line summarizes this relationship with a straight line.

### 📊 Example

Suppose:

| Experience (X) | Salary (Y in ₹k) |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| 1              | 30               |
| 2              | 40               |
| 3              | 50               |

The regression line might be:

$$
[
Y = 10X + 20
]
$$

So if someone has **5 years experience**:

$$
[
Y = 10(5) + 20 = 70 ,k
]
$$

### ❓ Socratic Questions

1. Why do you think we want a **line of best fit** instead of just connecting all points with a zig-zag line?
2. If slope ((m)) = 0, what does that mean about the relationship between X and Y?

### 🏋️‍♂️ Mini Exercise

Suppose the regression equation is:

$$
[
Y = 2X + 5
]
$$

* Predict Y when (X = 4).
* Predict Y when (X = 0).
