## Standard Deviation

### 📝 Explanation

**Standard Deviation (SD)** measures how **spread out** the numbers in a dataset are.

* While **variance** gives the *average squared deviation from the mean*, SD is the **square root of variance**, which brings it back to the **original unit** of the data.

Formula:

$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum (x_i - \mu)^2}$$

Where:

* $(x_i)$ = each data point
* $(\mu)$ = mean of the data
* $(n)$ = number of data points

### 🌍 Analogy

Think of **SD as measuring how tightly people cluster around a campfire**:

* Low SD → people are huddled close (little variation).
* High SD → people are scattered far apart (high variation).

### 📊 Example

Dataset: (2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9)

1. Mean $((\mu))$ = 5
2. Differences from mean: -3, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 4
3. Square differences: 9, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 4, 16
4. Variance = average of squares = (32/8 = 4)
5. Standard deviation = $(\sqrt{4} = 2)$

So SD = 2, which tells us most values are within ±2 units of the mean.

### ❓ Socratic Questions

1. Why do we take the **square root** of variance to get SD?
2. If all data points are equal (e.g., 5,5,5,5), what is the SD?
