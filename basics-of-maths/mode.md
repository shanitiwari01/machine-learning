## The Mode

### 📝 Explanation

The **mode** is the value that appears **most frequently** in a dataset.

* A dataset can have:

  * **One mode** (unimodal)
  * **More than one mode** (bimodal or multimodal)
  * **No mode** (if all values occur equally often)

---

### 🌍 Analogy

Imagine you’re in a cafeteria checking what most students ordered for lunch:

* If 15 chose pizza, 10 chose burgers, and 5 chose pasta → **pizza** is the mode.
  It shows the **most popular choice**.

### 📊 Examples

1. Data: (2, 4, 4, 6, 8) → mode = **4**.
2. Data: (1, 1, 2, 2, 3) → modes = **1 and 2** (bimodal).
3. Data: (5, 10, 15, 20) → no mode (all unique).

### ❓ Socratic Questions

1. If you were analyzing shoe sizes in a classroom, would the **mode** or the **mean** be more useful, and why?
2. Dataset: (6, 7, 7, 8, 8, 9) → what is the mode?
