## Ratio

### 📝 Explanation

A **ratio** compares two quantities, showing how many times one value contains or is contained in the other.

Formula:

$$
[
\text{Ratio of A to B} = \frac{A}{B} \quad \text{or written as } A:B
]
$$

Example:
If there are **8 apples** and **4 oranges**, the ratio of apples to oranges is:

$$
[
8:4 = 2:1
]
$$

It means: for every 2 apples, there’s 1 orange.
