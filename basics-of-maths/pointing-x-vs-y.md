## X vs Y (Independent vs Dependent Variables)

### 📝 Explanation

When we talk about **X vs Y**, we’re usually describing a relationship between two variables:

* **X = Independent variable (input, cause, predictor)**

  * This is what we control or choose.
* **Y = Dependent variable (output, effect, response)**

  * This is what changes *because of X*.

We then plot points as ((X, Y)) pairs on a **graph**.

Example:

* X = Hours studied
* Y = Exam score
* Points: (1, 50), (2, 60), (3, 70)

On a graph:

* X goes on the **horizontal axis**.
* Y goes on the **vertical axis**.

### 🌍 Analogy

Think of **X as a recipe ingredient** and **Y as the taste of the dish**:

* More sugar (X) → sweeter cake (Y).
* Less sugar (X) → less sweet cake (Y).
  The outcome (Y) depends on how much of the input (X) you used.

### 📊 Example

If your dataset is:

| Hours studied (X) | Marks scored (Y) |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| 1                 | 50               |
| 2                 | 65               |
| 3                 | 80               |

The points are: (1,50), (2,65), (3,80).
Plotting these shows a trend: more study hours → higher marks.

### ❓ Socratic Questions

1. Why do we put **X on the horizontal axis** and **Y on the vertical axis**?
2. If you see points going *upward* from left to right in an X vs Y graph, what does that usually mean about the relationship?

### 🏋️‍♂️ Mini Exercise

Imagine this dataset:

| Cups of coffee (X) | Energy level (Y out of 10) |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 0                  | 2                          |
| 1                  | 5                          |
| 2                  | 7                          |
| 3                  | 8                          |

👉 Write the coordinate pairs (X, Y).
👉 From this data, does Y increase, decrease, or stay the same as X increases?
