## Probability

### 📝 Explanation

**Probability** measures how likely an event is to occur.

Formula:

$$
[
P(E) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
]
$$

Where:

* (0 \leq P(E) \leq 1)
* 0 = event will never happen
* 1 = event will definitely happen

### 🌍 Analogy

Think of **probability as weather forecasting**:

* If the forecast says 0% rain → impossible.
* 100% rain → guaranteed.
* 50% → equal chance of rain or no rain.

### 📊 Examples

1. Toss a coin → Probability of Head = (\frac{1}{2} = 0.5).
2. Roll a dice → Probability of getting 4 = (\frac{1}{6}).
3. Deck of 52 cards → Probability of drawing a Heart = (\frac{13}{52} = 0.25).

### ❓ Socratic Questions

1. If you toss a coin 10 times and it comes up heads 7 times, does that change the probability of heads on the next toss? Why or why not?
2. Which is more likely: rolling a **6** on one dice, or rolling an **even number**?
