## The Mean

The average of set of numers.

### 📝 Explanation

The **mean** (often called the *average*) is the "balance point" of a dataset.
Formula:

$$
[
\mu = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}}
]
$$

Example: If exam scores are (60, 70, 80):

$$
[
\mu = \frac{60 + 70 + 80}{3} = 70
]
$$

It tells us the "central" or "typical" value.

### 🌍 Analogy

Think of a **seesaw** on a playground:

* Each child’s weight represents a data point.
* The **mean** is the point where the seesaw balances perfectly.

### ❓ Socratic Questions

1. If everyone in a dataset has the same number (say all are 10), what will the mean be?
2. What happens to the mean if one value is much larger than all the others (for example: (1, 2, 3, 100))?
