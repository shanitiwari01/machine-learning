## The Median

### 📝 Explanation

The **median** is the *middle value* in an ordered dataset.

* If there are an **odd number** of values → the median is the exact middle.
* If there are an **even number** of values → the median is the average of the two middle values.

It’s especially useful when data has **outliers** (extreme values) that would distort the mean.

### 🌍 Analogy

Imagine you’re lining up friends by **height**:

* The median is the person standing exactly in the middle of the line.
* It doesn’t matter how tall the tallest or shortest person is — the middle person defines the median.

### 📊 Examples

1. Data: (1, 3, 5) → median = **3** (middle value).
2. Data: (1, 2, 3, 4) → median = ((2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5).
3. Data: (1, 2, 3, 100) → mean = 26.5, but median = **2.5** (less affected by outlier).

### ❓ Socratic Questions

1. Why might the **median** be a better measure of “typical value” than the mean in a dataset with extreme outliers (like income data)?
2. If you have this dataset: (5, 10, 15, 20, 25) → what’s the median?
